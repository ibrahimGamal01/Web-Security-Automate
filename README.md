# script
This code uses Sublist3r to retrieve a list of subdomains for the inherited domain, and then uses Wfuzz and Wapiti to check each subdomain for vulnerabilities. The results of the checks are stored in a list and printed to the console at the end.

# demo

is a sample Python code that demonstrates how you might convert terminal commands to Python programs:
This code defines a terminal command as a string, and then uses the subprocess module to execute the command. The output of the command is captured and stored in a variable, which can then be printed or used in other ways in your Python program.

To convert multiple terminal commands to Python programs, you can simply define each command as a string and execute it using the subprocess module in a similar manner.
